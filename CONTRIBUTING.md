# Contributing

This is for code contributions.

## Basic Guidelines

### Use an IDE.
Specifically, desktop Pilas engine. Download it [here](https://pilas-engine.com.ar/descargas/). Some people use other tools, like VS Code, but I would personally not recommend them.

### Always test your changes.
Do not submit something without at least running the game to see if it compiles.  
If you are submitting a new block, make sure it has a name and description, and that it works correctly in-game. If you are changing existing block mechanics, test them out first.

### Do not make large changes before discussing them first.
If you are interested in adding a large mechanic/feature or changing large amounts of code, first contact us (Lean o Saba) via e-mail.  
For most changes, this should not be necessary. I just want to know if you're doing something big so I can offer advice and/or make sure you're not wasting your time on it.

### Do not create methods unless necessary.
Unless a block of code is very large or used in more than 1-2 places, don't split it up into a separate method. Making unnecessary methods only creates confusion, and may slightly decrease performance.  

## Other Notes
If you would like your name to appear in the game's credits, add it to the [list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).as part of your PR.
